import requests: This library is essential for making HTTP requests. It allows the script to communicate with the XposedOrNot API over the internet to retrieve breach data.

The check_email_breach function:

url: This is the API endpoint. It dynamically inserts the user's email into the address to ask the database for specific information about that account.

headers (User-Agent): This identifies our script to the server. It is a best practice in API development to let the provider know which "tool" is making the request.

requests.get(url, headers=headers): This line sends the actual request to the server and waits for a response.

Response Handling:

response.status_code == 200: In HTTP terms, 200 means "OK." The server successfully found data for the email.

data.json(): The API sends data back in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This line converts that raw data into a Python dictionary that we can easily read.

data.get('breaches', []): This looks for the list of leaked websites in the data. If the list is empty, it defaults to an empty list [].

if breaches:: This is our logic check. If the list contains names (like Adobe or LinkedIn), we alert the user. If it’s empty, the email is safe.

Error & Edge Case Handling:

elif response.status_code == 404: In this specific API, a 404 (Not Found) actually means Good News. It means the email has never been seen in a data breach, so we report it as "Safe."

except Exception as e: This is a "catch-all" safety net. If the internet is down or the API is offline, the script won't crash; instead, it will print a professional error message.
